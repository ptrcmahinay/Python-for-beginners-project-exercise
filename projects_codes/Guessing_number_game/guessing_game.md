[Back to readme](/README.md)

### The code for version 1:
[Version 1](guessing_game.py)
- A simple number guessing game that helps me practice working with random numbers, while loops and function. 

[Version 2](guessing_num.py)
- It uses a import package to the file (logo).
- uses multiple functions
- random functions
- if-else
- can hide and reveal the answer.
