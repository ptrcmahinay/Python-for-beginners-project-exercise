[Back to readme](/README.md)

## What I used when I making this game
1. List and Indexing
2. multiple functions
3. while loop
4. if-else

### The code for version 1:
[Version 1](rock-paper-scissor.py)
### Rules: 
- The player and computer both choose either rock, paper, or scissors
- Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock
- The first to reach 5 points wins the game
- Limited attempts to play again

### The code for version 2:
[Version 2](rps.py)
### Rules: 
- The user will set the score limit.
- The player and computer(random) both choose either 1 [rock], 1 [paper], or 2 [scissors].
- Then it will display the ASCII art for rock, paper, and scissors and will determine the if you won or lost the game and will count the score from the score limit.
- Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock
- The first to reach 5 points wins the game
